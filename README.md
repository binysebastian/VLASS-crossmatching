# VLASS-crossmatching



<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

 This project crossmatches between the sources identified from an input image file and the VLASS Quick Look source catalog. The source detection is carried out using PyBDSF. It writes out a table of source flux densities, and spectral index values estimated at the location of the source regions present in the VLASS Quick Look catalog. In addition, it prints the position and flux densities of the sources which were undetected in the single epoch images. It finally prints a crude flux density estimate and displays the single epoch image region around the undetected source.




<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
To be able to run the code on your local machine make sure you have the following prerequisites, a copy of the code and the inputs files.

### Prerequisites

This python code is dependant on few astronomy python packages.
* [bdsf](https://www.astron.nl/citt/pybdsf/)
* [astropy](https://www.astropy.org/)
* [casatasks](https://casadocs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebooks/usingcasa.html#Modular-Installation-of-CASA-6) (optional)
  

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/binysebastian/VLASS-crossmatching
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Inputs

The code requires the following user inputs.
* A quick look catalog of sources (eg: [CIRADA Quick Look catalogue](https://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/files/vault/cirada/continuum/VLASS_QL_comp_catalogues_yg/VLASS1QLCIR_v1/CIRADA_VLASS1QL_table2_hosts.csv.gz)).
* Two Single Epoch image file names (for the tt0 and tt1 images) ([see here for 4 sets of sample images](https://ws.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/files/vault/cirada/catalogues/github_files/testdata.tar)).


## Outputs

Several files are generated as output including

* The source catalog generated by PyBDSF.
* The mask fits file generated by PyBDSF.
* The spectral index image.
* The matched data catalog with total flux densities and spectral index values.
* A sub-catalog of sources with no matches in the single epoch image.
